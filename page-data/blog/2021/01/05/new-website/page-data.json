I actually started to rewrite my website using\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">GatsbyJS</a> a little more than a year ago, but then I\nended up working on several other projects and it's sat on my hard drive for\nquite a while. In particular, I've added this \"blog\" system, which I hope will\ngive me a location to provide some reference in use of my software, such as the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anchor-logoot\">AnchorLogoot project</a> once that matures a bit.\nI'm also hoping that I could use this as a location to document some of my\nengineering projects and what I've learned from them since I suppose it's a good\nidea to keep a public record of some of that work.</p>\n<h1>Problems with Gatsby</h1>\n<p>Though I find Gatsby to be quite useful, especially on a site with lots of\nimages, I've encountered a fair number of problems with it. For example, Gatsby\nhas suffered from <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/3406\">performance issues.</a>.\nIn the case of a friend's website, it took hours to build a website with\nhundreds of images. Furthermore, I've often encountered issues where updating\nan official Gatsby package by a minor or bugfix version only causes breakage.\nThis is not to say that you shouldn't use Gatsby: I'm aware of these issues yet\nI still use it. It's just good to keep in mind that the site doesn't maintain\nitself.</p>\n<p>Gatsby <em>does</em> build an insanely fast website for your visitors. In my view, the\noccasional slow build and dependency issue is worth the super fast website,\nespecially since my images are properly scaled and given a sourcemap. Plus, I\ncan write my blog in markdown and have it generate HTML. If you are comfortable\ndealing with a few problems here and there, I would certainly recommend Gatsby.</p>\n<h1>Styling</h1>\n<p>I decided to use <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">TailwindCSS</a> for styling. For areas\nlike the navbar, it's quite a bit easier to have the styles right in the HTML,\nthough I did have to use plain CSS for some pseudoelements. For the actual style\nitself, I decided on something similar to the Glow theme that I wrote for Matrix\nNotepad, but with sharper corners. In particular, I used <code>clip-path</code> to create\nrectangles with slanted corners, which you can see with the blog tags and the\nprojects. Unfortunately, these don't work on Internet Explorer, but IE is slowly\ndisappearing and the fallback is just a normal rectangle, which I'm fine with.\nThere's still a fair number of CSS bugs to work out, but nothing too horrible.\nOverall, the code styling is a bit weird, too, since I'm not using ESLint, but\nthat's not at the top of my priority list.</p>\n<h1>Hosting</h1>\n<p>I'm still running my website off GitHub pages, but I'm looking into IPFS-based\nsolutions as well. However, I have my concerns with the speed and reliability of\nIPNS, and I don't want to use my DNS to point directly to the content address if\nI plan on updating the site frequently.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Website","description":"I've updated my website to build using GatsbyJS on GitHub Actions with Tailwind CSS.

        <h1>LearnASM: An educational assembly code simulator in your web browser</h1>
        <p>In the Spring of 2017 I undertook a project that I initially thought required assembly, so I learned ARM assembly. While I did not end up needing assembly code to complete this project, I discovered that learning assembly code had actually made me a better programmer. Now I can actually understand why pointer variables work, for example.<br\>

        In the spring of the same year, my school required that I use the programming language Scratch for a school project. My initial idea was to create a tile-based game, however I found this to be nearly impossible. I found that Scratch was very effective at teaching people how to use Scratch, but did not necessarily make good programmers. I believe the reason for this is because Scratch does teach people how to use if and else statements, but it does not teach people how to break down their ideas into really tiny chunks. Yes, they have blocks to, say, "move a sprite," but those are still fairly large chunks.<br\>

        Long story short, I came up with a crazy idea: Teach novice programmers assembly.<br\>

        Ok, so I might be insane, but hear me out. With a user interface that allows people to actually see what is going on inside a computer, for the first time this might actually be practical. Users can understand how a computer is actually put together and understand that its not just magic.<br\>

        Of course, if this all doesn't work, I have written a fairly cool assembly code simulator, so win-win either way.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Nathan Pennie, aka KB1RD! I work as the Chief Technology Officer for <a href="https://nescitech.org">New England Sci-Tech</a> and I am a founding member of the Sci-Tech Youth Amateur Radio Society. (STARS) I have an Amateur Extra class radio license and enjoy working with computers and electronics. I use Linux as my primary OS and I am a supporter of the Free Software Movement. In my free time I code (mostly C++) and I design electronic circuits, most of the time for New England Sci-Tech kits. You won't find me on the air often, mostly because I don't have a HF radio. If you'd like to talk to me, you can often find me at New England Sci-Tech for the Tuesday night STARS meetings. </p><p>73,<br>KB1RD</p>
